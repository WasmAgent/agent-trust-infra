> **FROZEN PACKAGES — do not open issues, write tests, or make any changes:**
> `trust-passport-core` and `trust-runtime` are frozen. All Trust Passport
> feature work has moved to `WasmAgent/open-agent-audit`. Any bullet below that
> would require touching these packages must be implemented in that repo instead.

## Milestone 6 — Production Hardening (Phase 6)

Begins when research preview graduates to production. **No Trust Passport work here** — `trust-passport-core` and `trust-runtime` are frozen; all Trust Passport work lives in `open-agent-audit`.

- [x] `@wasmagent/trust-cli` npm publish with binary builds for Linux, macOS, Windows — AgentBOM and MCP Posture CLI only (Trust Passport CLI lives in `open-agent-audit`) — publish workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, README at `cli/README.md` (issue #285)
- [ ] Compliance profile registry: `soc2-2024`, `iso27001-2022`, `eidas-controlled` with verified mapping to actual regulatory text
- [ ] `docs/cli.md` — complete command reference and examples for all shipped CLI commands
- [x] Static site for `papers/` directory so technical reports are browseable on the web

## Milestone 7 — Ecosystem & Standardization (Phase 7)

- [ ] AgentBOM as standalone specification repository if external adoption warrants
- [ ] MCP Posture as standalone MCP security product if demand appears
- [x] Propose AgentBOM to OpenSSF or equivalent standards body for cross-org adoption — proposal at `docs/openssf-proposal.md` (issue #200)

- [ ] Continuous Trust Monitoring service — daemon that watches agent runtime BOM drift, detects permission escalation attempts, and alerts on trust boundary violations; integrates with existing observability stacks (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Major agent framework integrations — official LangChain, LlamaIndex, and AutoGen plugins that auto-generate AgentBOM manifests from agent definitions; publish to respective package registries
- [x] Multi-party trust negotiation protocol — RFC for federated Trust Passport exchange between organizations, enabling cross-org agent deployment with mutual attestation and policy reconciliation — RFC at `specs/trust-passport/rfc-multi-party-negotiation.md` (issue #216)
- [ ] Production trust-cli hardening — SIGSTORE verification for signed artifacts, air-gapped installation mode, FIPS-compliant crypto backends, and enterprise SSO integration for attestation workflows
- [ ] Trust analytics dashboard — web UI for visualizing trust posture across agent fleets, BOM dependency graphs, compliance heatmaps, and audit log search with temporal filtering
- [x] BOM versioning and migration framework — semver-compatible schema evolution tooling with automated migration scripts, backward compatibility shims, and deprecation warnings for legacy AgentBOM/MCP Posture versions — framework at `agentbom-core`/`mcp-posture-core` index.ts, CLI `agentbom migrate`/`mcp-posture migrate` (issue #226)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and SLIs — published throughput/latency benchmarks for validation operations, SLO guidance for production deployments (guidance at `docs/slo-guidance.md`, issue #233), and regression test suite for performance degradation (framework at `internal/performance/`, issue #234)

## Milestone 9 — Trust Chain Operations & Distribution (Proposed)

- [x] `trust-cli publish <artifact.json>` — publishes signed trust artifacts to a distribution registry with content-addressable storage (CAS) identifiers and immutable versioning — command at `cli/src/trust-publish.ts` (issue #239)
- [x] `trust-cli pull <artifact-id>` — retrieves trust artifacts from the registry by CAS identifier with integrity verification and dependency resolution — command at `cli/src/trust-pull.ts` (issue #240)
- [x] `trust-cli subscribe <agent-identity>` — sets up continuous monitoring for trust artifact updates from specific agent publishers with notification callbacks — command at `cli/src/trust-subscribe.ts` (issue #241)
- [ ] AgentBOM schema: add `distribution` object with `registry_uri`, `publication_timestamp`, `deprecation_status`, and `supersedes` fields for artifact lifecycle management
- [ ] MCP Posture schema: add `verification_endpoint` field specifying URL for real-time posture verification with token-based authentication

- [ ] Compliance framework integration: automated mapping updates when AgentBOM schema evolves, with backward compatibility checking for existing compliance profiles
- [ ] `trust-cli audit-stream <agent-identity>` — continuous audit log streaming with real-time compliance violation detection and alerting integration

This milestone transforms the trust infrastructure from a static artifact system into an operational distribution and verification platform, enabling multi-agent ecosystems to publish, discover, and verify trust artifacts at scale.

## Milestone 10 — Production Operations & Federation (Phase 10)

**Focus:** Transition from research preview to production-ready infrastructure supporting multi-org trust chains and continuous compliance operations.

- [ ] **Performance Baselines & SLA Targets** — define throughput/latency SLAs for AgentBOM generation (10k-agent repos in <60s), Trust Passport validation (<100ms p99), and audit trail queries; publish benchmark suite with per-component performance regression guards
- [ ] **High-Availability Schema Distribution** — CDN-backed JSON schema distribution with geo-replication, version pinning via content-addressable URIs, and graceful fallback for offline environments (supports air-gapped enterprise deployments)
- [ ] **Automated Policy Enforcement Engine** — `trust-cli enforce-policy <bom.json> --policy <org-policy.yaml>` — validates agent artifacts against organization-specific trust rules (tool allowlists, MCP server whitelists, data handling classifications) with configurable enforcement levels (warn/block/quarantine)
- [ ] **Continuous Compliance Monitoring** — daemon service that watches agent registries for drift, validates new commits against established trust baselines, surfaces violations via webhooks (PagerDuty, Slack, GitHub Security); enables compliance-as-code for agent fleets
- [ ] **Federated Trust Chain Protocol** — specification for cross-organization trust propagation (Agent A from Org X invokes Agent B from Org Y); defines trust-passport chaining, liability boundaries, and evidence aggregation; enables B2B agent collaboration with auditability
- [ ] **Certificate Authority Integration** — PKI integration for Trust Passport signing (enterprise CA support, certificate rotation automation, revocation checking via OCSP/CRLs); replaces dev-mode key generation with production-grade key management
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Isolation** — tenant-scoped trust artifact storage with RBAC, audit trail segregation per organization, and resource quotas; supports SaaS deployments serving multiple customers from single infrastructure
- [ ] **Operational Observability Stack** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and structured logging for all trust-cli operations; operational insights into validation failures, schema usage, performance degradation, and security events
- [ ] **Regulatory Reporting Automation** — `trust-cli report --framework <soc2|iso27001|ai-act> --period Q1-2026` — generates compliance-ready reports from Trust Passport and audit trail data; maps trust artifacts to control objectives with evidence citations
- [ ] **Webhook & Event System** — extensible webhook framework for trust lifecycle events (passport issued/revoked, policy violation, compliance drift); supports custom payloads, retry logic with exponential backoff, and signature verification
- [ ] **Graduated Staging Environments** — staging/promotion pipeline mirroring production; supports blue-green schema rollouts, canary validation rules, and automated rollback on regression detection
- [ ] **Legacy Agent Migration Tooling** — trust artifact generation for pre-AgentBOM agents via static analysis and behavioral fingerprinting; enables onboarding of existing agent fleets without manual intervention
